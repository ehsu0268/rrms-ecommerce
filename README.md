# RRMS-eCommerce

## Overview

This development task involves creating frontend functionality
that has two buttons, one for products and one for carts.

The products button will list products in a table.
Each row is able to expand with additional information about the
product.

There is an "Add Product" button which opens a form with fields to create a product. All the fields are mandatory. Upon form completion, a success messsage is shown and the form is dismissed.

The carts button will list carts in a table.
Each row contains information about the user who generated the cart and the products that are inside.

## Design

I used Typescript and React to build the web application.

I used mui-material package to generate the table functionality.
